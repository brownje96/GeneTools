# GeneTools
This is my best-effort attempt to make some tools to make working with genetic information easier, strictly spearheaded out of necessity in biology class. I am not a biologist. I will not *be* a biologist. I am a Computer Science college student. Should you choose to use these tools, I wish you the best of luck with hopes that it is useful and accurate. There is likely professional software for this purpose already; this is a child's toy in comparison.
